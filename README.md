## Features
- We are able to generate images randomly on page load, as well as when clicking the "Show New Random Cover"!
- You can switch to and from the different forms of "View Saved Covers" and "Make Your Own Cover" without issues. 
- We are also able to create your own custom cover, with YOUR favorite image!
- After creation of your desired pages, you can save it.. and if it isn't exactly what you wanted, you can delete it!

## Deployed Page
