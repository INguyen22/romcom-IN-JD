## Introduction
  - The purpose of this project was to allow students to practice some of the foundational concepts learned so far within the module. There are other extensions that test different skills that we can build on. But the main ones for this project were manipulating the page after it has been loaded by adding, removing and uploading elements on the DOM. We also had to practice reading HTML/CSS while looking for clues on the direction we should take to address the iterations.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS


## Illustrations

## Features
- We are able to randomize a cover on page load, as well as when we click the "Show New Random Cover" button. 
- We can switch to and from the different "views" with ease.
- We are also able to create a new personalized cover, with whatever image/gif you please!
- You are able to save your created cover, and any cover you liked that was randomized... and view it in the "View saved Covers"... and if you don't like it.. double click it and "automagically" it's gone!!!!

## Deployed Page

Visit our published Hang In There Site! [here](https://inguyen22.github.io/romcom-IN-JD/)

## Possible Future Extensions
- Being able to create a different view essentially and it enlarges your saved cover on click.. would be cool!
